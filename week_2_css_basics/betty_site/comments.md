Here's where you can find my comments on you work as you progress...always look for the comments.md file :)

Good job with the about me page. You still need to add the picture of betty white and make sure the words wrap around it. A few other tiny details are missing, like the accents about the 'e's in resume...this can be done by adding unicode characters to your html file.

The resume is even better, great attention to detail! The only comment I have about it is make sure you pay attention to spacing and indentation in your files...makes them easier to read for you and anyone else working with you code later!

Keep up the great work!
